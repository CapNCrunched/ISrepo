	<p> Company name: D’Fresh D’sign (as in “the fresh design”. Also works with my name Doug)
		Field: Multimedia Design

The idea for my company came from the idea that in this day of age, advertising plays a major role in companies’ business aspects. I was thinking in terms of profit so I decided to go with a multimedia design company which requires a little more creativity then say a security. This is, for one, displayed in the flamboyant name itself. D’Fresh D’sign or the fresh design is specifically a company that would design specific items for a  business that intends to grab the attention of the younger populace, specifically from ages 18-28 range, an age group where the individuals simply don’t prefer old fashion. For my advertisement logo, I created an all light blue name with an assortment of random white blotches and a flowing font that helps soothe the eye. Then to make the transition from the name to the checkmark, I used the same blue color, but added a waffle outline that sort of guides the eye through the entire logo. Then to keep it interesting as the observer travels along the check mark, I added three circles consisting of a blue, red and yellow beaded fill just to mix things up a bit and give the emblem a young feeling. The other way to look at it is that the observer sees the logo first due to the black outline I gave it. The logo contrasts the name just enough so that passing by the logo you would naturally glance at it. By getting a consumer to glance at the logo, you also get the consumer to acknowledge the name of your company. I feel that the name stays consistent and sophisticated and the logo is reliable, meaning that it’s not too flashy but at the same time not to plain.
